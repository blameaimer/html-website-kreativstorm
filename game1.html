        The world of Elden Ring is called the Lands Between – a large realm
        ruled by demigods and blessed by the power of the Elden Ring and the
        Erdtree. A meme that you might have seen doing the rounds joked that
        Elden Ring is in fact set in the US state of Ohio, but, unsurprisingly,
        this is false. The lands of the Lands Between are simply one giant,
        mystical continent surrounded by water. We’ve found the Elden Ring map
        fragments, so take a look to get the lay of the land. The Lands Between
        and the world of Elden Ring is completely new and separate from previous
        FromSoftware titles. While the world has still been developed by
        Hidetaka Miyazaki and the FromSoftware team, George R. R. Martin, author
        of the "A Song of Ice and Fire" series that was the basis for Game of
        Thrones, was also brought on to assist with developing the world and
        mythos of Elden Ring. You, the player, will start your Elden Ring
        journey in a region to the south known as Limgrave – a relatively
        nice-looking area that features grassy plains, valleys, woods, cliffs,
        and ancient ruins. As you explore, you’ll eventually come across the
        disease-blighted region of Caelid that’s full of undead horrors, the
        misty wetlands of Liurnia, and numerous more varied regions with their
        own environments and creatures.
